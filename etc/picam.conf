# The command to check if the zone needs motion capture.
# Context: motion_supervise
#
# If the zone is considered "secure", then motion detection is disabled.
# If the zone is considered "insecure", then motion detection is enabled.
#
# - must exit 0 if the zone is secure
# - must exit other than zero if the zone is not secure
# 
# examples:
# 
# - custom script of your own:
# CHECK_ZONE_CMD="/home/motion/is_zone_secure"
#
# - simple ping (if ping is responding, then the zone is secure):
# CHECK_ZONE_CMD="/bin/ping -w 1 -c 1 12.0.0.31 > /dev/null"
#
# - /bin/true: the zone is alaways secure
#   totally useless: will never enable motion
# CHECK_ZONE_CMD="/bin/true"
#
# - Checks if a string is present on a web page.
#   If needed, the credentials must be written in /home/motion/.wgetrc
#   The Wireless status page of DD-WRT is Status_Wireless.live.asp
